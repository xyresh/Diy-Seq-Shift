# Diy-Seq-Shift
A sim Racing Sequential Shifter, Included are mechanical Drawings, wiring diagram and The code 

The Parts Necessary for the Mechanical Build are:
  >2 Connecting Plates that Are normally Used for connecting V-Slot Rail Parts. 
  
  >4 M5 Bolts and about 6 Nuts or more
  
  >a M10 Bolt Threaded Shaft, about 100mm with a 5mm Hole around the 45mm Mark 
  
  >an adapter from M10 to the shifter Knob of Your Preference
  
From an Electronics Point of View You will Need:
  
  >2 Micro Switches with a short Handle that can be mounted on the M5 Bolts(I drilled out the screw holes a bit more to fit them on the bolts)
  
  >A Rasberry pi pico
  
  >Some Wire

As For Software you need to Install CircuitPython onto your Pi Pico in order for this to work.
Also you will need the Adafruit HID library which can be found Here:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/tag/20210417

and once you drag and drop the adafruit-hid folder into your lib folder within the pi pico storage
and the code.py file you will be ready.
The Default Buttons are the 'C' and 'V' Key equivalents but you can change these at any time

This Project is Completely Open Source and You can do whatever you like with these Designs and the Code That is Provided.
